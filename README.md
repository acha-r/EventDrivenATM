# EventDrivenATM
This console application is a refactored and updated version of the multilingual ATM machine. This new version follows an event-driven approach, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient ATM experience. EventDrivenATM supports both English and French languages, providing a user-friendly interface for a diverse range of users.

## Features
EventDrivenATM currently supports the following functions:

a. Withdrawal: Perform cash withdrawals from your account. Simply input the desired amount, and the ATM will dispense the requested cash if sufficient funds are available.

b. Transfer: Transfer funds to another account. This feature is limited to four banks for now. Input the recipient's account information and the amount to transfer, and EventDrivenATM will handle the transaction securely.

c. Print Receipt: After each transaction, EventDrivenATM offers the option to print a receipt. The receipt includes the transaction details and the updated account balance, providing a convenient way to track your transactions.

Please note that this is the current functionality of EventDrivenATM, but future updates may introduce additional features.
